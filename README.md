# UCM-Capstone-Project

The Exoplanet Exploration Program needs a deep learning model to predict and identify confirmed exoplanets in distant star systems. The stakeholders of this project are all exoplanetary scientist working at NASA. I have been contracted as a Data Scientist to create this model given the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) Dataset.
